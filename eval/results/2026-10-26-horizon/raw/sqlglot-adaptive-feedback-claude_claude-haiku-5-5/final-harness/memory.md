- The project's checks run with `<work>/env-sqlglot/bin/python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider --color=no`.
- Layout: expression classes live in `sqlglot/expressions/*.py` (there is no `expressions.py`). A dialect's parser is `sqlglot/parsers/<d>.py` and its generator is `sqlglot/generators/<d>.py`; `sqlglot/dialects/<d>.py` only wires them together.
- The full suite (~1100 tests) takes 60–80 s alone; `tests/test_executor.py::TestExecutor::test_execute_tpcds`
  is slowest and looks hung under CPU contention. Run the dialect's own test file first (<1 s).
